Python Foundations
==================

These introductory Python lessons provide the training necessary for learners interested in the NASA *ScienceCore* curriculum, ["Satellite Data and Models for Computational Climate or Agricultural Science."](https://openclimatescience.github.io/) Each lesson below is intended to require 2 hours (when taught in a workshop format).

1. [**Introduction to Python**](https://github.com/OpenClimateScience/Python-Foundations/blob/master/01_Introduction.ipynb) - Start here if you have never used Python or any other programming language before
2. [**Building Python Proficiency**](https://github.com/OpenClimateScience/Python-Foundations/blob/master/02_Building_Python_Proficiency.ipynb) - Start here if you have some Python experience or ample experience in other languages
3. [**Introduction to NumPy**](https://github.com/OpenClimateScience/Python-Foundations/blob/master/03_Introduction_to_NumPy.ipynb)
4. [**Raster Data Analysis in Python**](https://github.com/OpenClimateScience/Python-Foundations/blob/master/04_Raster_Data_in_Python.ipynb)
